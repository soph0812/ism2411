# Reflection 1:
# The most surprising thing about lists is that they can be changed after
# they are created. I also learned that negative indexing lets me access
# items from the end without knowing the exact length of the list.
# Reflection 2:
# A Python list would have saved me time in an accounting or business class
# when working with a large inventory of products. Instead of manually
# sorting and calculating totals in Excel, I could use Python to organize
# the products and quickly calculate the information I need.
